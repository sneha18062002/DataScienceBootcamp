#1. Write a function  count_vowels(word) that takes a word as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the word

word = input()
def count_vowels(word):
    vowelcount =0
    for i in range(0, len(word)):
        if word[i] =='a' or word[i] =='e' or word[i] =='i' or word[i] =='o' or word[i] =='u'or word[i] =='A'or word[i] =='E'or word[i] =='I'or word[i] =='O'or word[i] =='U':
            vowelcount += 1
    return vowelcount 
vowelcount = count_vowels(word)
print(vowelcount)

#2. Iterate through the following list of animals and print each one in all caps. animals=['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther']

animals = ['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther']
for i in animals:
    print(i.upper()) 

#3. Write a program that iterates from 1 to 20, printing each number and whether it's odd or even.

for i in range(1, 21):  # Iterate from 1 to 20
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        print(f"{num} is even")
    else:  # If not even, it's odd
        print(f"{num} is odd")

#4. Write a function sum_of_integers(a, b) that takes two integers as input from the user and returns their sum.

def sum (a,b):
    c=a+b
    return c
    
num1 = int(input ("Enter number 1 : "))
num2 = int(input ("Enter number 2 : "))
sumofnumber = sum(num1,num2)
print(sumofnumber)
